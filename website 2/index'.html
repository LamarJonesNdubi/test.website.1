    <h2>Early Life</h2>

    <p><big>Rasputin was born on January 21, 1869, in the Siberian village of Pokrovskoye.
         Little is known about his early life, but he reportedly had a religious awakening 
         during a pilgrimage in the 1890s.</big>

    <h2>Rise to Influence</h2>
    <img src="image2.jpeg" alt="Rasputin" width="500">
    <p><big>Rasputin's reputation as a mystic and healer brought him to the attention of Tsar Nicholas II
       and Tsarina Alexandra. He was introduced to the royal family around 1905, primarily due to his 
       supposed ability to heal their son, Alexei, who suffered from hemophilia.</big>

    <h2>Influence on the Romanovs</h2>
    <img src="image3.jpeg" width="500" alt="">
    <p><big>Rasputin's influence grew as he became a close confidant of the Tsarina, particularly because she
       believed he could heal Alexei. This relationship led to rumors and accusations that Rasputin was 
       controlling the royal family and meddling in government affairs.</big>
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2>Controversial Figure</h2>
    <img src="image6.jpeg" width="500" alt="">
    <p><big>Rasputin was a polarizing figure. Some viewed him as a holy man with miraculous powers, while others
       saw him as a <i>charlatan</i> and a debauched manipulator. His presence at court and rumored involvement in
       political decisions contributed to the growing discontent with the monarchy.</big>

    <h2><span style="background-color: bisque;">Assassination</span></h2>
    <img src="" alt="">
    <div style="background-color: red;">
    <p><big>Rasputin's influence and the scandal surrounding him made him many enemies. On the night of <b>December 
       29, 1916,</b> a group of nobles led by Prince Felix Yusupov and Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich lured Rasputin
       to Yusupov's palace and attempted to poison him. When the poison failed, they shot him multiple times,
       and finally, they drowned him in the Neva River.</big>

    <p><big>Rasputin's life and death have been the subject of numerous myths and legends. His story has inspired 
       countless books, films, and other works of art. He remains a fascinating and enigmatic figure in Russian
       history, often symbolizing the decline and fall of the Romanov dynasty.</big>
